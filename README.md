## Objectives of the course

**Week 1**

1. Find and complete intro R resources as needed (see [cran.r-project.org/other-docs.html](https://cran.r-project.org/other-docs.html)), then master advanced techniques for R programming using first half of *Advanced R* completing associated assignments.
2. Learn the basics of git, using the command line, on your local machine (see [git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Git-Basics](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Git-Basics)).
3. Use git to fork this repo, and another of your choice, and copy to local.

**Week 2**

1. Complete *Advanced R* with associated assignments.
2. Use git to access and become familiar with R package repos on github.
3. Contribute a stand-alone function, with documentation, to an existing R package.

**Week 3**

1. Outline and create your own (small) R package, collaborating with a partner, with repo on github.
2. Review the R package of another student group.

## Some recommendations

* Use RStudio for development, and for git version control, after learning the command line.
* Use roxygen2 for documenting your functions and package.
* Use R markdown and knitr for creating reports.
* Submit issues to github.
